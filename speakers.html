<h5> Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmmakers </h5>
<p> Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with combination of well written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It&#8217;s the filmmaker&#8217;s job to put this together. To do so they have developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.</p>

<p> With this workshop we&#8217;ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#8217;ll look at some tools used in films, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and story boards. We&#8217;ll consider why they&#8217;re used and how we might look to them as inspiration.</p>

<h5>Death to wireframes: LongLive Rapid Prototyping</h5>

<p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>
